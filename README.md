  ## Designing the deck
  
  ### Description
  The deck of a skateboard(31x8) which is a light purple with 8 holes and a fillet on all of the edges. The deck is the main part of a skateboard that is stood on so stability and design are vital.

  ### Reflection 
  It ended up taking me a while to remember how to mate together parts but after I got through that it was smooth sailing. While creating the deck I acquired a new understanding of naming my parts, I got to the very end of the deck and I needed to go back and fix a dimension. Because I didn't name the sketch, I had to go back one by one and open every drawing I had to find the incorrect dimension.
  
## Designing the trucks
  
  ### Description
  The trucks of a skateboard hold the wheels and help the board turn and tilt to change directions. (i made my trucks  blue and grey cause those are both the best colors.)

  ### Reflection 
  I was stuck on the trucks for hours. I love cad and typically find it easy but while I was mating the inner circles for the different parts of the trucks the mates never worked out. I had to repeat almost every mate at least 3 times before it worked. After I got through that it was a very simple part.
  
## Designing the wheels and bearings
  
  ### Description
  The wheels started out as two rectangles and by using the revolve tool they gained the abiltyy to roll. The bearings are what help the wheels roll smothly while being connected to the trucks and deck.

  ### Reflection 
   Overall the creation process of the wheels and bearings was pretty simple. I once again struggled for a solid two days on the mating, with revolves there are 6 different inner circles to choose from when mating. Only one out of the six circles gives you the correct orientation for the mate. The bearings also likes to go through the wheel while I was going through that mating process.
  
 ## Putting it all together
  
  ### Description
  I created a skateboard in onshape using 4 different parts. I created the wheels , bearings, deck, and trucks seperatly then mated them all together.

  ### Reflection 
  
This skateboard truly tested my patience. I struggled a lot with all the mates as I typically try to avoid mating anything when doing my Onshape projects. I used reloves, fillets and quite a few other tools to create a skateboard with two trucks, a deck, four wheels, and four bearings.
