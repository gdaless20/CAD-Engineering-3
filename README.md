  ## Designing the deck
  
  ### Description
  The deck of a skateboard(31x8) which is a light purple with 8 holes and a fillet on all of the edges. The deck is the main part of a skateboard that is stood on so stability and design are vital.

  ### Reflection 
  It ended up taking me awhile to remember how to mate together parts but after I got through that it was smooth sailing.
  
## Designing the trucks
  
  ### Description
  The trucks of a skateboard hold the wheels and help the board turn and tilt to change directions. (i made my trucks  blue and grey cause those are both the best colors.)

  ### Reflection 
  I was stuck on the trucks for hours. I love cad and typically find it easy but while i was mating the inner circles for the different part of teh trucks the mates never worked out. I had to repeat almost every mate at least 3 times before it worked. After i got through that it was a very simply part.
  
## Designing the wheels and bearings
  
  ### Description
  The wheels started out as two rectangles and by using the revolve tool they gained the abiltyy to roll. The bearings are what help the wheels roll smothly while being connected to the trucks and deck.

  ### Reflection 
  Over all the cretion process of the wheels and bearings were pretty simple. I omce again stuggled for a solid 2 days on the mating , with revolveds there are 6 different inner circles to choose from when mating . Only one out of the six circles gives you the correct orientation for the mate. The bearigs also likes to go through the wheel while i was going through that mating process.
